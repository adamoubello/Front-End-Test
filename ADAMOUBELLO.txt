I'm prioritizing this way regarding to the technical difficulty level of each tasks. 

In a technical point of view,I consider firstly tasks that, i think, are easy to implement.

So the easiest one is task 1: Improve the facilities block and the less easy one is task 6:Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.




1->   Improve the facilities block.

2->   Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and
 	some nearby landmarks.

3->   Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Include an automatic slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually controll the carousel, add a layer that shows the
	contents of the images alt text.

4->   Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

5->   Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy
 	or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display
 	additional information about rooms.

6->   Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
 	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.
